# Time of Concentration / Time to Peak

## Airport Method

> For catchments where the runoff coefficient, C, is less than 0.40, the Airport formula may provide a better estimate of the time of concentration. This method was developed for airfields and calculates time of concentration as a function of runoff coefficient, length, and slope.

$T_c=\frac{3.26(1.1-C)L^{0.5}}{S_{w}^{0.33}}$

where

- $C$, runoff coefficient
- $L$, catchment length (m)
- $S$, catchment slope (%)

## Bransby-Williams

> This equation assumes catchment runoff is quickly concentrated into channel flow. It is most applicable where channels exist, or the drainage area has a steep grade.

$T_c=\frac{0.057L}{S^{0.2}A^{0.1}}$

where

- $L$, channel flow length (m)
- $A$, drainage area (sq. miles)
- $S$, slope (%)

## Kinematic Wave

> This equation applies to planes of sheet flow of homogenous slope and roughness. Cumulative watershed travel time should be summation of sub-areas with different slopes or overland roughness.

$T_c=\frac{6.94nL^{0.6}}{i^{0.4}S^{0.3}}$

where

- $L$, overland sheet flow path length (m)
- $n$, manning's surface roughness
- $i$, rainfall intensity (mm/hr)
- $S$, slope (m/m)
